# agento

  Little PoC with autonomous agents


## implemented

  * Agents selectable and controllable (select with mouse, toggle control with 'f')
  * Ability to trace agent's paths (toggle selected agent with 't', toggle trace all with 'T')

## Some ideas:

  * Add some kind of IA (currently agents are just wandering around)
    * Field of vision
    * Decision making heuristic
  * Make some inherited types of agents
  * Add different kinds of entities
